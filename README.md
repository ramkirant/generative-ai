# Generative AI

## Precursors

### What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence is a broad field of computer science that focuses on creating intelligent systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.

### How would machines be able to perform tasks that require human intelligence?

Machines would be able to perform these tasks by leveraging **Machine Learing**

### What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on development of algorithms or models that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. 

### What is needed for a machine to learn?

- Huge sets of Training Data
- High Computational Power
- Optimized and Resilient Training Algorithms.

### What are the different variants of Machine Learning?

- Deep Learning

### What is Deep Learning?

Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that learns using the concept of neurons of a human brain. Deep Learning leverages Neural Networks to process data. Neural Network is a network of multiple machines where the data is passed from one layer of machines to another. Each layer of machines processes the data and sends it to the next layer for further processing. Neural Networks need a lot of computational power which is the reason for a resistence to adopt them during the early days. Recently, this computational power is made easily available. GPUs have become much more cheaper and have become more affordable. This made adoption of Neural Networks for various Deep Learning use cases easy.

## Where does Generative AI fits into this Artificial Intelligence Landscape?

Generative AI is a subset of Deep Learning. It uses Deep Learning Neural Networks to learn from the Training Data and generate new content from it. 

Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) is a type of AI that can create new content, such as audio, images, text, code, videos etc.
